## Game Rules

Othello is a strategy board game for two players. The game is played on an 8x8 board with two types of discs: black and white. The objective is to have the majority of your color discs on the board at the end of the game.

### Basic Rules:

1. Players take turns placing their discs on the board.
2. A player can only place a disc in a position where it captures one or more of the opponent's discs.
3. Captured discs are flipped to the player's color.
4. The game ends when neither player can make a valid move, or the board is full.

## How to Play

1. Choose your game mode: Player vs Player or Player vs Computer.
2. Select the starting player.
3. Adjust the board size and number of blocks if desired.
4. Click on the board to place your disc.
5. The game will automatically switch turns between players.
6. Use the Undo and Redo buttons to manage your moves.
7. At the end of the game, you will see the winner and have the option to start a new game.

Enjoy playing Othello!
